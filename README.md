Very simple inverted filter.
# Installation

## Prerequisites
In order to compile this project you will need to:
- have [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) installed on your system. If you don't know how to do it see [this link](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html).

Inspired by trending-filter on Tiktok. 
I've created a very very small project (technically a short .cpp file).
